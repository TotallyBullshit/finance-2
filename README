scrapy application for scraping some financial data

REQUIRES:
=========

scrapy (http://scrapy.org)
w3lib (https://github.com/scrapy/w3lib)
python-mysql

INSTALLATION:
=============

If you want to store scraped data:

1. Create mysql database and grant all privileges on a given user (recommended to create new one for this application)

example:

>> create database finance;
>> grant all privileges on finance.* to 'finance_user'@'localhost' identified by "financepassword";

(replace finance, finance_user and financepassword by your custom strings)

2. Create database tables by dumping file finance.scheme:

$ mysql -u root -p finance < finance.scheme

3. Create a file local_settings in same place as file settings.py, with mysql settings. In this case its content would be:

MYSQLDB_NAME = "finance"
MYSQLDB_USER = "finance_user"
MYSQLDB_PASS = "financepassword"

======
